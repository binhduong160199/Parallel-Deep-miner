# Parallel-Deep-miner

This is an exercise in the course OOP (C++) in FH Technikum Wien ([Beispiel5.pdf](https://github.com/binhduong160199/Parallel-Deep-miner/files/11668446/Beispiel5.pdf))

Object-Oriented Programming

It is a good exercise to practice inheritance and threading. 

I completed the exercise using CLion. After that, I wrote unit tests, exceptions, and also implemented operation overloading for the exercise. If you want to run the unit tests, you need to change the configuration in "Edit Configuration" and then add the doctest.
